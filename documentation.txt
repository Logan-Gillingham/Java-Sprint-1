The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage a library's collection of books, periodicals, and other items. It allows users to add, search, borrow, and return items, as well as manage authors and patrons.

How to Use the System:

Start the Application: Run the Demo class to launch the application.
Main Menu: The main menu will display various options, including adding items, searching for items, borrowing items, returning items, and exiting the system.
Add Item: Enter the item's details, such as ID, title, author, ISBN, publisher, number of copies, and format.
Search Items: Enter a search query (title or author name) to find matching items.
Borrow Item: Enter the item ID and patron ID to borrow an item.
Return Item: Enter the item ID and patron ID to return an item.
Exit: Exit the application.

Explanation of Class Diagram:

LibraryItem: The base class for all library items. It contains common attributes like ID, title, author, ISBN, publisher, number of copies, and availability status.
Book: A subclass of LibraryItem representing books. It has an additional attribute for format (printed, electronic, or audio).
Periodical: A subclass of LibraryItem representing periodicals. It has additional attributes for issue number and publication date.
Author: Represents an author with name and birth date.
Patron: The base class for all patrons. It contains attributes like name, address, phone number, and borrowed items.
Student: A subclass of Patron representing student patrons.
Library: Manages the library's items, authors, and patrons. It provides methods for adding, searching, borrowing, and returning items.

Source Code Structure:

The source code is organized into a package structure, with each class residing in its respective file. The main class, Demo, serves as the entry point for the application.

Build Process:

Compile: Use a Java compiler to compile the Java source files into bytecode.
Run: Use the java command to execute the compiled class file.
Compiler Time Dependencies:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
A suitable IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
Development Standards:

Follow Java coding conventions and best practices.
Use meaningful variable and method names.
Add comments to explain complex logic.
Write clean and well-structured code.

Database Design (Theoretical):

A relational database could be used to store the library's data.
The database would have tables for items, authors, patrons, and borrowing history.

Additional Notes:

This documentation provides a basic overview of the library management system.
For more advanced features and customizations, refer to the source code and comments within the code.
Consider using a version control system like Git to manage your project's source code.
Explore additional libraries and frameworks to enhance the functionality and user interface of the application.
